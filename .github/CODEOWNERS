# It uses the same pattern rule for gitignore file
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. 

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @EmersonEcologic/proxy-dev-code-crawlers team will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
