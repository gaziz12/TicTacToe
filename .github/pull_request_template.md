Make sure the title and description are clear and concise.

# Pull Request title

Title should be in the following format if possible:

```
CR-XXXX: Summary of the changes made
```

Where: CR-XXXX refers to the issue number in https://emersonecologics.atlassian.net/projects/CR 

Most PRs will require an issue number. Trivial changes, like fixing a typo, do not need an issue.

# Backport Pull Request title

If this is a backport PR (PR made from `master` or `release`[..etc] to lower branches to resolve dependencies) ) ,
please ensure that the PR title is in the following format:

```
HEAD_BRANCH::BASE_BRANCH - <what is the goal of this backport> 
```

Where: HEAD_BRANCH is the source branch name, and BASE_BRANCH is the remote branch name.
